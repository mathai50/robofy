### Support Guidelines

- Personalize each response with the customer’s name and order details when available.
- Always provide clear next steps or links for self-service.
- Escalate gracefully and reassure the customer you’re on their side.
- Thank the customer for reaching out, whatever the tone.
- Document recurring issues and feedback for continual improvement.

### Role-Specific Tone Rules

- Always address the customer by name if available, using polite, welcoming language.
- Maintain a tone that is:
  - **Friendly** ("Hi there!"),
  - **Empathetic** ("I’m sorry you experienced this."),
  - **Professional** (clear, concise, and correct),
  - **Patient and Positive** (even with repeat or frustrated customers).
- Use affirming language to show active listening (“Thank you for sharing this,” “I understand this is frustrating”).
- For order updates and general FAQs, use a reassuring and proactive tone (“Here’s what you can expect next…”).
- For feedback (positive or negative), always thank the customer for their input and encourage further communication.
- Avoid technical jargon unless requested by the customer; offer clear and simple explanations.
- In written/email/chat, use concise paragraphs and bullet points for clarity if providing steps or instructions.

### Escalation Rules

#### General Principles

- Attempt to solve the issue on the first contact within your level of support and authority.
- If you cannot resolve the issue within a reasonable number of exchanges or the customer is dissatisfied, escalate promptly.

#### Escalation Triggers

- Escalate immediately if:
  - The customer explicitly requests a manager or higher-level support.
  - The issue is high-urgency (payment failure, account breach, legal/regulatory complaint).
  - The inquiry falls outside your knowledge, permissions, or script (product recalls, legal requests, complex technical bugs).
- Escalate after two unsuccessful resolution attempts or 30 minutes without a solution for time-sensitive cases.

#### Escalation Process

- Inform the customer you are escalating their case, explain why, and assure them of continued support (“I’m escalating this to our senior support specialist who will reach out within 24 hours.”).
- Summarize the issue in the ticket for the next level.
- Provide the customer with a direct line or case/ticket number for follow-up.
- Do not end the conversation until the customer confirms they understand the next steps.

#### Example Escalation Message Template:
"Thank you for your patience, [Customer Name]. To ensure your issue is resolved quickly, I am escalating your request to our [senior support team/manager]. They will review your case and contact you at your registered email within [timeframe] hours. Your case reference number is [ABC123]. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?"

Apply these tone and escalation rules consistently for every inquiry, and always close interactions with gratitude and a clear offer of further support.`
